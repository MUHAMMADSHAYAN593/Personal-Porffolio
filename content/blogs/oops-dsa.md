excerpt: "A beginner-friendly guide to understanding Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms."

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) are two pillars of computer science that every programmer should master.  
OOP helps you **organize and structure code**, while DSA improves **problem-solving and efficiency**.

---

## Part 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** â€” instances of classes that bundle **data (attributes)** and **methods (functions)**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Core Principles of OOP

1. **Encapsulation** â€” Wrapping data and methods together in a single unit.
2. **Inheritance** â€” Reusing and extending functionality from other classes.
3. **Polymorphism** â€” Writing methods that behave differently based on the object.
4. **Abstraction** â€” Hiding complex implementation details, showing only the necessary parts.

---

### ðŸ’» Example in JavaScript

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Buddy barks.
````

### âœ… Why Learn OOP?

* Helps organize large projects.
* Increases **code reusability**.
* Makes it easier to **maintain and debug**.

---

## Part 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

DSA is about **storing data efficiently** and **processing it quickly** using well-defined algorithms.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Common Data Structures

| Data Structure | Description                     | Example Use Case          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Array          | Ordered collection of items     | Storing a list of names   |
| Linked List    | Nodes connected by pointers     | Undo/Redo in text editors |
| Stack          | LIFO (Last In, First Out)       | Browser history           |
| Queue          | FIFO (First In, First Out)      | Task scheduling           |
| Hash Table     | Key-value pairs for fast lookup | Caching data              |
| Graph          | Nodes connected by edges        | Social networks           |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example: Stack in JavaScript

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}

const stack = new Stack();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
console.log(stack.peek()); // 20
stack.pop();
console.log(stack.peek()); // 10
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step method to solve a problem.
Some important algorithm categories:

* **Searching**: Linear Search, Binary Search
* **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
* **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm
* **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem

---

### ðŸ“Œ Example: Binary Search in JavaScript

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
    else high = mid - 1;
  }

  return -1;
}

console.log(binarySearch([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 7)); // 3
```

---

## Final Thoughts

* **OOP** helps you design **clean, reusable code**.
* **DSA** helps you solve **complex problems efficiently**.

Learning both will make you a **well-rounded developer** capable of building scalable, maintainable, and efficient software.
